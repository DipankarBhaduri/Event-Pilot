Efficient Calendar Event Scheduling Prototype 📅
This repository houses a prototype for a web application designed to streamline calendar event scheduling. Developed using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB, our objective is to provide users with essential functionalities for efficient schedule management. Below, you'll find instructions for setting up the application, an overview of its functionalities, and considerations for further development.

Functionalities 🚀
User Busy Slots:

Users can effortlessly create busy slots for themselves throughout the day.
Event Retrieval:

Fetch events for individual users and other specified users seamlessly.
Conflict Checking:

Identify events where users have conflicts for a particular day, ensuring a conflict-free schedule.
Optimal Slot Selection:

Organizers can intelligently find the most favorable upcoming empty slot for a given set of users and a specific duration.
Event Creation:

Users can easily create events with other users for a defined start time and end time.
Bonus Extensions 🌟
Recurring Events:
Organizers have the flexibility to create recurring events for a specific number of times, maintaining consistent start and end times with the same set of users.
Technology Stack 🛠️
Java: The primary backend programming language, chosen for its versatility and reliability.
Spring Boot: Selected for its simplicity and efficiency in developing robust applications.
MongoDB: Employed as the NoSQL database to store and manage calendar events.
How to Run the Service ⚙️
Clone the repository: git clone [repository_url]
Navigate to the project directory: cd calendar-event-scheduler
Build the project: ./mvnw clean install
Run the application: ./mvnw spring-boot:run
The application will initiate, and you can access the APIs to leverage the specified functionalities.
